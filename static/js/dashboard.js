That wasn‚Äôt the decision, it was merely the decision to answer the question. We went to answer the question by talking to a wide array of local and national groups. We spoke to our whole community, in one way or another. I think the answer was pretty clear that, while so many of us who have grown up with the name and thought of it as nothing more than the name of our team and that it did not intend to have a negative impact on anybody, in particular Native Americans, it was having a negative impact on those folks. Locally, the American Indian Movement of Ohio, the Lake Erie Professional Chapter of the American Indian Science and Engineering Society, the Committee of 500 Years of Dignity and Resistance and the Lake Erie Native American Council publicly advocated for a name change. Dolan said civic leaders who cater to the underserved were equally as strong in their support of a name change. A fifth-generation Clevelander, Dolan said he understands that many fans do not agree with the team‚Äôs decision. I hope that those who do not [agree with the decision] take the time, like we did, to better understand the issues and think about a role a sports team plays in the community and whether we can play that role with a name like Indians. Dolan said the team will continue to celebrate its long history as the Indians after a new name is installed. The team will continue to engage with the community during the selection process for a new name, which he acknowledged as ‚Äúdifficult and complex. The process of moving away from Indians is not going to be easy,‚Äù Dolan said. ‚ÄúWe understand it‚Äôs going to be difficult for a lot of people to make that adjustment. But I hope, over time, we embrace the process of reimagining our name. Hopefully it will be a name the community can rally around, and we hope it has more than a 105-year life to it.",
