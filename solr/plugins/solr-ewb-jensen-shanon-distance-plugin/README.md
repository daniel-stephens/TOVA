# solr-ewb-jensen-shanon-distance-plugin

 Vector Scoring Plugin for Solr based on Jensen–Shannon divergence.

 This plugin is a modification of the ["Vector Scoring Plugin for Solr : Dot Product and Cosine Similarity"](https://github.com/saaay71/solr-vector-scoring) to be adequate for Solr 9 and the calculation of the Jensen–Shannon divergence.
