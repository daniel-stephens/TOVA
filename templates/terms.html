      <p class="mb-3">
        These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of TOVA
        (“TOVA”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), including any related web interfaces,
        desktop applications, and services that organize, visualize, and analyze text.
        By creating an account, logging in, or using TOVA, you agree to these Terms.
        If you do not agree, you must not use TOVA.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h5 mt-4">1. Eligibility and Accounts</h2>
      <p>
        You must be at least 18 years old, or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction,
        to use TOVA. You are responsible for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Providing accurate and complete registration information.</li>
        <li>Maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials.</li>
        <li>All activities that occur under your account.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You must notify us promptly if you suspect any unauthorized access to your account.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h5 mt-4">2. Use of TOVA</h2>
      <p>
        TOVA is designed to help you organize, visualize, and analyze text data.
        You may upload or input documents, notes, or other content (“User Content”) and,
        optionally, enable integrations with Large Language Models (“LLMs”) such as
        OpenAI or local models (e.g., Ollama).
      </p>
      <p>You agree that you will not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use TOVA for any unlawful, harmful, or abusive purpose.</li>
        <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to any accounts, systems, or networks.</li>
        <li>Interfere with or disrupt the operation of TOVA.</li>
        <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract source code from TOVA, except where permitted by law.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="h5 mt-4">3. User Content</h2>
      <p>
        You retain ownership of the User Content you submit to TOVA. You are solely responsible
        for ensuring that you have all necessary rights to upload and process that content.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using TOVA, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide license to process
        your User Content solely for the purpose of providing and improving TOVA’s features,
        including text organization, visualization, analysis, and related functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are responsible for ensuring that your User Content does not violate any applicable
        law or third-party rights (including privacy, confidentiality, and intellectual property rights).
      </p>

      <h2 class="h5 mt-4">4. LLM Integrations and API Keys</h2>
      <p>
        TOVA may allow you to connect to third-party LLM providers such as OpenAI or local
        runtimes such as Ollama. You may need to provide your own API keys or organization IDs
        (“LLM Credentials”) to enable these features.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You are responsible for any costs or usage charges from third-party LLM providers.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for complying with the terms and policies of each provider.</li>
        <li>
          Where configured, your User Content and prompts may be sent to those providers
          for processing in order to provide summaries, suggestions, or other LLM-powered features.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        TOVA is not responsible for how third-party providers handle your data. Please review
        their terms and privacy policies before enabling any integration.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h5 mt-4">5. Local Models (e.g., Ollama)</h2>
      <p>
        When using local models such as Ollama, processing may occur on your own device or infrastructure.
        You are responsible for maintaining the security and configuration of your local environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        TOVA does not control local runtimes and is not responsible for issues arising from their installation,
        configuration, or operation.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h5 mt-4">6. Availability and Changes</h2>
      <p>
        We may add, remove, or modify features of TOVA at any time. We may also suspend or terminate
        access if we reasonably believe you have violated these Terms or pose a risk to TOVA or other users.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h5 mt-4">7. No Professional Advice</h2>
      <p>
        Output generated or displayed in TOVA, including any LLM-based summaries or recommendations,
        is provided for informational purposes only. It does not constitute legal, financial, medical,
        or other professional advice. You should not rely on such output as a substitute for professional judgment.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h5 mt-4">8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
      <p>
        TOVA is provided “as is” and “as available”. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim
        all warranties, whether express, implied, or statutory, including any warranties of accuracy,
        reliability, non-infringement, merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not guarantee that TOVA will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or free of harmful components.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h5 mt-4">9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event will TOVA, its developers, or contributors be liable
        for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of data, profits,
        or revenue, arising out of or in connection with your use of TOVA.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our total liability for any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or your use of TOVA will not
        exceed the amount you paid (if any) for access to TOVA in the twelve (12) months preceding the event
        giving rise to the claim.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h5 mt-4">10. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify and hold harmless TOVA, its developers, and contributors from and against
        any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees)
        arising out of or in connection with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your use of TOVA.</li>
        <li>Your User Content.</li>
        <li>Your violation of these Terms or any applicable law.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="h5 mt-4">11. Termination</h2>
      <p>
        You may stop using TOVA at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access to TOVA at any time
        if we reasonably believe you have violated these Terms or if we decide to discontinue the service.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h5 mt-4">12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice,
        for example by updating the “Last updated” date or via in-app notification. Your continued use of TOVA
        after the changes take effect constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.
      </p>
