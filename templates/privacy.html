      <p class="mb-3">
        This Privacy Policy explains how TOVA (“TOVA”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) collects,
        uses, and protects information when you use our services, including any web
        interfaces and desktop applications that organize, visualize, and analyze text data.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h5 mt-4">1. Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3 class="h6 mt-3">1.1 Account Information</h3>
      <p>
        When you create an account, we may collect:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Name</li>
        <li>Email address</li>
        <li>Authentication information (such as password hashes for local login)</li>
        <li>Identifiers from third-party identity providers (e.g., Okta user IDs) when you sign in using SSO</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="h6 mt-3">1.2 User Content</h3>
      <p>
        TOVA enables you to upload or input text, documents, and related data (“User Content”)
        for organization, visualization, and analysis. Depending on how you use TOVA, this
        content may include information that is confidential or sensitive.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h6 mt-3">1.3 LLM-Related Information</h3>
      <p>
        If you choose to connect TOVA to Large Language Models (“LLMs”), we may collect:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Configuration details about your LLM provider (e.g., provider name, model name).</li>
        <li>API keys or organization IDs that you provide for third-party providers (e.g., OpenAI),
          where we store them to send requests on your behalf.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you use LLM-powered features, portions of your User Content, prompts, and generated
        output may be sent to the configured provider for processing.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h6 mt-3">1.4 Usage and Log Data</h3>
      <p>
        We may collect basic usage information, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dates and times of access.</li>
        <li>Pages or features used.</li>
        <li>Technical information about your device or browser (e.g., IP address, OS, browser type), when applicable.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="h5 mt-4">2. How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide, maintain, and improve TOVA’s features and functionality.</li>
        <li>Authenticate users and secure access to accounts.</li>
        <li>Organize, visualize, and analyze your User Content as requested by you.</li>
        <li>Enable optional integrations with LLM providers and local models.</li>
        <li>Monitor usage patterns and diagnose technical issues.</li>
        <li>Communicate with you about updates, changes, and support for TOVA.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="h5 mt-4">3. How We Handle User Content and LLM Data</h2>
      <p>
        Your User Content is processed solely to provide the features you choose to use in TOVA.
        When you enable LLM integrations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          TOVA may send portions of your User Content, prompts, and context to third-party
          providers such as OpenAI to generate summaries, suggestions, or other responses.
        </li>
        <li>
          The handling of data by those providers is governed by their own terms and privacy policies.
          You are responsible for reviewing and complying with those terms.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you use local models (e.g., via Ollama), processing may occur on your own machine
        or infrastructure. TOVA does not control your local runtime and does not transmit that
        processing to our servers unless explicitly configured to do so.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h5 mt-4">4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information
        against unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration. However, no system can
        be completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where API keys or tokens are stored, we aim to protect them using appropriate safeguards.
        You should:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use strong, unique API keys and rotate them periodically.</li>
        <li>Revoke keys from your provider if you believe they may be compromised.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="h5 mt-4">5. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain information for as long as necessary to provide TOVA and fulfill the purposes
        described in this Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may request deletion of your account and associated data, subject to applicable legal
        obligations and technical limitations.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h5 mt-4">6. Sharing of Information</h2>
      <p>We do not sell your personal information.</p>
      <p>We may share information in the following circumstances:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Service Providers:</strong> With trusted service providers who assist in hosting,
          logging, monitoring, or other operational tasks, under appropriate contractual safeguards.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>LLM Providers:</strong> With third-party LLM providers you explicitly enable
          (e.g., OpenAI), for the purpose of processing your prompts and content.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> When required by law, regulation, subpoena, or
          legal process, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of TOVA, our users, or others.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In connection with a merger, acquisition, or other
          transfer of assets, subject to appropriate confidentiality protections.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="h5 mt-4">7. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        If TOVA is accessed via a web interface, we may use cookies or similar technologies
        to maintain sessions, remember preferences, and analyze usage. You can control cookies
        through your browser settings, but disabling certain cookies may affect some functionality.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h5 mt-4">8. International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on where you are located, your information may be stored or processed in countries
        that may have different data protection laws than your jurisdiction. Where required by law,
        we will take steps to ensure appropriate protections are in place.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h5 mt-4">9. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information,
        such as the right to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access the personal information we hold about you.</li>
        <li>Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete information.</li>
        <li>Request deletion of your personal information, subject to legal obligations.</li>
        <li>Object to or restrict certain types of processing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To exercise these rights, you can contact us at
        <a href="mailto:support@example.com">support@example.com</a>. We may need to verify
        your identity before responding to certain requests.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h5 mt-4">10. Third-Party Services and Links</h2>
      <p>
        TOVA may link to or integrate with third-party services, such as LLM providers,
        identity providers (e.g., Okta), or external websites. This Policy does not apply
        to those services. Their own policies govern how they handle your information.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h5 mt-4">11. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        TOVA is not intended for use by children under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly
        collect personal information from children. If you believe we have unintentionally
        collected information from a child, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h5 mt-4">12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes,
        we will provide notice, for example by updating the “Last updated” date or via
        in-app notification. Your continued use of TOVA after the updated Policy takes
        effect constitutes your acceptance of the changes.
      </p>
