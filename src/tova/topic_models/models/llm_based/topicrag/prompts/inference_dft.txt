Act as an expert text classifier. Your goal is to categorize the document below into one of the pre-defined valid topics.

Context:
Valid Topics List:

Document:
{doc_text}

Rules:
1. PRECISION: If the document clearly fits a topic, return the topic name exactly as listed.
2. PRIORITY: If multiple topics apply, select the single most dominant one.
3. EXCLUSION: If the document does not fit any topic significantly, return exactly 'Outlier'.
4. SILENCE: Return ONLY the topic name or 'Outlier'. Do not include labels, explanations, punctuation, or introductory text.

Format your response exactly as:
[Topic Name OR 'Outlier']
