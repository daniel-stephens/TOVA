You are an expert model in content classification and labeling. You are given a set of keywords and three representative documents related to that set.

Your task is to analyze the keywords and the content of the documents to generate a single clear and concise label that accurately reflects the general topic related to the keywords.

The label must:  
- Be specific enough to distinguish itself from other labels, but without including unnecessarily detailed terms that make it too long or inflexible for future documents.  
- Avoid overly broad or generic terms that could result in redundant or uninformative labels.  
- Not be or include the word "LABEL".  
- Match the language of the keywords.  

Your response must be only the generated label, with no additional text.  

Keywords: {keywords}  
Documents: {docs}  
Label:
